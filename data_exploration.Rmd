```{r setup.1, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r setup.2}
library(data.table, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(igraph, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```

## Whole data set

```{r load_complete_metag_data.1}
<- 

```

## Subset

## Cooccurrence Data

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r load_cooccurrence_data.1}
cooccurrence_data <- read.table("data/raw/temp", 
                                col.names = c("OTU_1", "OTU_2", "rho", "p"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
