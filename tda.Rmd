# Persistent homology

We'll begin our exploration of topological data analysis with the application of persistent homology.  We'll start on the soil column data set, as there has been a clear signal demonstrated in NMDS plots indicating separation between soil-treated and manure-treated columns.  Afterwards, we'll move on to applying persistent homology to our data set.

## Soil column 

We'll begin by reading in the soil

```{r read.arg}
soil_column.args <- readRDS

```
